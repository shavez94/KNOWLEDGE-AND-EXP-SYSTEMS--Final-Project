If you were not a party to the order, you should explain how you are directly affected by the order. Describe in detail the alleged serious error and/or explain why you were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing. Indicate if you want the LTB to stay (suspend) the order while the review is decided and provide reasons for the stay.

What constitutes an illegal act for the purpose of eviction under section 61 of the RTA?,"A contravention of the RTA would not, in itself, constitute an illegal act under section 61 of the RTA. If there is a remedy for the act elsewhere in the RTA, it would not be appropriate to evict for an illegal act. For example, a failure to pay rent would not be considered an illegal act for the purpose of section 61. Subletting or assigning the rental unit without the landlord's consent would not necessarily constitute an illegal act that justifies eviction."
What can I do if my tenant is conducting an illegal business in the rental unit?,"You can bring this to the attention of the landlord and provide evidence of the illegal business.

You have the right to dispute the termination at the Landlord Tenant Board hearing and present your side of the story.
What is the notice period for illegal drug-related activities by a tenant?,"The notice period for illegal drug-related activities by a tenant is 10 days, as per Subsection 61(2)(a). This notice period is shorter due to the potentially serious implications for the landlord and other tenants. An application to terminate a tenancy based on such a notice is processed more quickly than most other types of applications."
What notice period can a landlord give for a second breach after a void notice?,"If the first notice became void due to tenant's compliance, the landlord may give a 14-day notice instead of a 20-day notice for a second breach, unless it's for one of the three drug-related activities in subsection 61(2)(a) where the termination date is already a minimum of 10 days after the notice is given."
What is the definition of an illegal drug according to the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA)?,"According to subsection 61(3) of the RTA, an illegal drug means a controlled substance or precursor as defined in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).

What should I do if my landlord accuses me of drug possession?,"If your landlord accuses you of drug possession, they should give you a 20-day notice under subsection 61(2)(b) instead of a 10-day notice under subsection 61(2)(a). You may want to seek legal advice and respond to the notice accordingly."
What does 'production' mean in the context of illegal drugs according to the Act and CDSA?,"According to subsection 61(3) of the Act, 'production' with respect to an illegal drug means to produce the drug within the meaning of the CDSA.

The Landlord Tenant Board may order an eviction even if the tenant has not been charged with an offence relating to the illegal act. Conversely, being charged with an offence is not necessarily proof of committing an illegal act. The Board may evict a tenant for an illegal act whether or not the tenant has been convicted of an offence relating to the illegal act."
How can I argue for relief from eviction?,"You can argue for relief from eviction by demonstrating to the Member that the termination of the tenancy may be unfair considering all the circumstances. This involves showing that the eviction should be refused or delayed, even if the tenant has committed an illegal act that justifies eviction."
What factors should I consider when seeking relief from eviction based on an illegal act?,"When seeking relief from eviction based on an illegal act, you should consider factors such as the length of the tenancy, your financial circumstances, whether there are children living in the unit, any past problems, and the likelihood of the illegal act being repeated."
What can I do if my landlord is trying to evict me for keeping a dangerous animal in the rental unit?,"You can request relief from eviction by explaining the situation to the Member at the Landlord Tenant Board.

Can I rely on Interpretation Guideline 10 to support my case?,"You can refer to Interpretation Guideline 10 to understand the Board's usual interpretation of procedural issues regarding eviction applications. However, it's important to note that a Member is not required to follow a Guideline and may make a different decision depending on the facts of the case."
How can I use the cases mentioned in Interpretation Guideline 10 to support my case as a tenant?,You can refer to these cases to understand how procedural issues were handled in eviction applications. Look for similarities in your situation and use the rulings to support your arguments.

What should I do if my landlord gives me a notice of termination with an inadequate termination date?,"If your landlord gives you a notice of termination with an inadequate termination date, you can challenge it by filing an application with the Landlord Tenant Board. The Board has no authority to shorten the notice period required by the Residential Tenancies Act, so if the notice period is shorter than required, your application will likely be dismissed."
What should I do if I receive an unsigned Notice of Termination from my landlord?,"If the Notice of Termination has the landlord's name shown, it may still be considered valid according to the Divisional Court of Ontario. However, you should carefully review the notice for any other errors, such as an incorrect termination date, as this could render it invalid. If you believe the notice is invalid, you may want to seek legal advice or consider disputing it through the Landlord Tenant Board."
What should I do if I receive a confusing Notice of Termination from my landlord?,"If you receive a confusing Notice of Termination from your landlord, you may consider seeking legal advice or assistance from a tenant advocacy organization.

What should I do if I believe the Notice of Termination was not served to me properly?,"If you believe the Notice of Termination was not served to you properly, you can raise this issue at the hearing.

Can a landlord use their own version of the approved forms for Notices of Termination and Applications?,"Yes, landlords can use their own versions of the approved forms as long as the form includes the information set out for the tenant in the Board form.

What can I do if my landlord serves me with a second Notice of Termination?,"If your landlord serves you with a second Notice of Termination under section 68 of the RTA, you cannot void this notice.

What should I do if my landlord claims I am not in possession of the rental unit?,"If your landlord claims you are not in possession of the rental unit, you can provide evidence of your control over the unit, such as access to, use of, or occupation of the unit.

However, the landlord may be able to claim rent arrears by filing an Application to Collect Rent the Former Tenant Owes (L10 Application) instead."
What happens if I am still in possession of the rental unit and the landlord is terminating the tenancy for non-payment of rent?,"If the landlord is terminating the tenancy for non-payment of rent and you are still in possession of the rental unit on the date of the hearing, you may be ordered to pay rent arrears up to the hearing date.

How can I avoid termination of my tenancy for non-payment of rent?,"You can avoid termination of your tenancy for non-payment of rent by paying all the rent arrears and costs specified in the order before it is enforceable, in accordance with subsection 74(4) of the RTA.

For example, if you did not pay the May rent, but paid in June, the payment for June will be applied to May leaving the June rent outstanding."
Can I still pursue arrears of rent if I have vacated the rental unit?,"Yes, you can still pursue arrears of rent even if you have vacated the rental unit. You can file an application with the Landlord Tenant Board to request the owed rent."

The order will end the tenancy effective the date you moved out without ordering enforcement through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) and require you to pay rent arrears ending on the date the tenancy ended. Unlike orders for arrears and termination where the tenant is in possession of the unit on the hearing date, the order would not provide you with an opportunity to continue the tenancy by paying all of the arrears by a specified date."
Can my landlord apply my rent deposit to the rent arrears?,"No, the landlord cannot apply the rent deposit to the rent arrears before applying to evict the tenant. The rent deposit can only be applied to the last month of the tenancy."
What can I do if the amount owed to the landlord is actually a negative amount after deducting the deposit and interest?,"In this case, the LTB may order the landlord to pay you the amount that will be owed as of the order date. This is in accordance with section 205 of the RTA, which states that the LTB may order that 'The landlord or the tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.' You can bring this to the attention of the LTB during your hearing."
What should I do if I want to stop the eviction order from being issued?,"You can pay the landlord all of the arrears, the application fee, and any additional rent owed before the eviction order is issued. This will result in the landlord's application being discontinued."

The order becomes enforceable on the date specified for possession to be given to the landlord by the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)."
What should I do if I have paid the full amount to the landlord or into the LTB's trust account on or before the date the order is enforceable?,"If you have paid the full amount on time, the order is automatically voided, and the landlord cannot enforce it with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff). If you have paid the entire amount to the landlord or part to the landlord and part to the LTB, you may file a motion with the LTB, without notice to the landlord, asking for a Member to issue an order determining that you have paid the full amount due and confirming that the order is void. Such an order will be made without holding a hearing."
How can I set aside the eviction order after paying the full amount specified in the order?,"You can file a motion with the LTB, on notice to the landlord, to set aside the eviction order. This type of motion can only be made once during a tenancy."

What can I do if I paid the landlord with a non-certified cheque and they are concerned it may be returned NSF?,You can request an adjournment or ask for permission to make post-hearing submissions to allow time for the cheque to clear before the final order is made. This can be done by contacting the Member holding the hearing and explaining the situation.
Can a landlord file an L9 Application without giving the tenant a notice of termination?,"Yes, a landlord does not need to give the tenant a notice of termination before filing an L9 Application with the LTB. However, the tenant must be in possession of the rental unit on the date the landlord files the L9 Application."
How can I calculate the rent arrears I owe?,"You can calculate the rent arrears you owe up to the end of the current month in which the hearing is held. The LTB can order you to pay arrears of rent, but not rent that has not come due as of the hearing date. The amount of rent arrears may be affected if you abandoned or vacated the rental unit without providing a valid notice of termination, or if the parties did not enter into an agreement to terminate the tenancy."
How can I calculate the rent arrears if I vacated the rental unit without giving notice?,"If you vacated the rental unit without giving any notice, arrears of rent are owing for the period that ends on the earliest termination date that could have been specified in a notice of termination had you given notice in accordance with the RTA. This means the arrears would be calculated up to the earliest termination date that could have been specified in a notice of termination given in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act."
Can the rent deposit be deducted from the rent arrears in an L9 order?,"In an L9 order, the rent deposit is not usually deducted from the arrears because the tenancy is not being terminated. However, if the LTB determines that the tenancy has already been terminated, the rent deposit is deducted from the arrears awarded to the landlord. This is in accordance with Section 106(10) of the RTA, which states that a rent deposit must be applied to the last rental period before the tenancy terminated."
Can I get my rent deposit back if I move out by the termination date specified on the notice of termination?,"Yes, according to section 106(10) of the RTA, if you move out by the termination date specified on the notice of termination, the rent deposit must be applied to the last rental period before the tenancy terminated.

How should I serve the L10 Application to my former tenant?,"According to section 189.0.1 of the RTA, you are responsible for giving the application and notice of hearing to each former tenant. Make sure to do this at least 30 days before the hearing, as per LTB Rule of Procedure 5.8."
How can I serve the L10 Application to the former tenant?,"You can serve the L10 Application to the former tenant by handing the document(s) to the former tenant(s) or an apparently adult person at their current residence. If that's not possible, you can also send the document(s) by mail or courier to their current residence, ensuring that the address is identified. If the former tenant agreed in writing to receive documents by email during the tenancy, and you can prove they received the document(s) by email, you can also serve it via email."
"What can I do if my landlord claims to have served me with an application and notice of hearing, but I never received it?","You can dispute the landlord's claim at the hearing and request evidence of how they determined your current residence. If you did not receive the application and notice of hearing, you can explain this to the Board and request a new hearing date."
How can I request alternative service if my landlord is unable to serve me with the L10 Application?,You can request alternative service by submitting a Request to use Alternative Service to the Landlord Tenant Board. This request must be submitted at least 40 days before the hearing and should explain why the landlord has been unable to serve you using the standard methods and why they believe you will receive the documents using the proposed alternative method.
What should I do if my landlord fails to serve me with a copy of the L10 Application and notice of hearing?,"If your landlord fails to serve you with a copy of the L10 Application and notice of hearing, you can bring this to the attention of the Landlord Tenant Board. The LTB may cancel the hearing and close the application if the Certificate of Service is not submitted at least 20 days before the hearing. This could result in the landlord's filing fee not being refunded."
What should I do if my landlord did not include my current residence in the L10 Application?,"If your landlord did not include your current residence in the L10 Application, you should inform the Landlord and Tenant Board of your current address as soon as possible. This is important so that the LTB can provide you with a copy of the order issued after the hearing. You can do this by contacting the LTB and providing them with your updated address."
What can I do if I need to make amendments to my application with the Landlord Tenant Board?,"You can request to amend your application at the hearing, as long as the LTB is satisfied that the amendment is appropriate, would not prejudice any party, and is consistent with a fair and expeditious proceeding. For example, if a notice is found to be defective during the hearing, the LTB may allow the landlord to amend the application to a different type, such as from an L1 to an L9 application."
What can I do if my landlord tries to amend the application from L1 or L9 to L10?,"If your landlord tries to amend the application from L1 or L9 to L10, you should ensure that you are aware of the hearing and the landlord's rent arrears claims.

It's important to attend the hearing and present your case to the Member."
Can a landlord claim NSF charges and administrative charges in a rent arrears application?,"Yes, under section 87(5) of the RTA, a landlord can include a claim for the amount of NSF charges paid to a financial institution in respect of cheques tendered by the tenant, plus administrative charges limited to a maximum of $20.00 per cheque as per Ontario Regulation 516/06. These charges, if proven, may be awarded to the landlord in addition to other amounts payable to prevent eviction."
Can my landlord include NSF charges in a notice of termination?,"No, according to subsection 59(3) of the RTA, including NSF charges on a notice of termination is likely to invalidate the notice. The tenant is only required to pay the arrears and additional rent to void the notice, not the NSF charges."
What should I do if my landlord is claiming an unpaid rent deposit on the N4 of termination?,"If your landlord claims an unpaid rent deposit on the N4 of termination, it will invalidate the notice. You can bring this to the attention of the Landlord and Tenant Board as it goes against the guidelines outlined in the Residential Tenancies Act."
Can my landlord claim unpaid utility costs as rent arrears?,"No, unpaid utility costs are not considered rent arrears and cannot be claimed in an N4 notice of termination or an L1 or L9 Application. However, the landlord may be able to claim expenses incurred due to unpaid utility costs using a L2 Application, or a L10 Application if the tenant has already vacated the rental unit."
Can my landlord include unpaid utility costs in a notice of termination?,"If you and your landlord have agreed that you will be responsible for paying all utility costs directly to the utility company, then the unpaid utility costs cannot be included in a notice of termination. Including unpaid utility costs on a notice of termination in this circumstance will likely invalidate the notice."
Can I include unpaid utility costs on an N4 form for rent arrears?,"In the circumstance where the tenant agreed to pay a certain percentage of the utility expenses to the landlord at the beginning of the tenancy, including unpaid utility costs on an N4 form for rent arrears may likely invalidate the notice. This is because the amount owed for utilities is not considered to be 'rent' under section 116 and 119 of the RTA. It's important to review the specific details of your tenancy agreement and seek legal advice if needed."
Can my landlord charge me for utilities?,"If your tenancy agreement requires you to reimburse the landlord for a portion of the utility cost, it must be in accordance with the rules made under Ontario Regulation 394/10. The utility charges should not be considered as part of the rent."
What can I do if my landlord is seeking expenses for utility costs that I was required to pay?,"You can review your tenancy agreement to confirm your responsibility for utility costs. If you were indeed responsible and failed to pay, the landlord may seek an order for these expenses using a L2 Application. It's important to carefully review the terms of your tenancy agreement and seek legal advice if needed."
Can my landlord include charges for installing a mobile home or transferring to another unit in a notice for non-payment of rent?,"No, the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) does not allow landlords to include charges for installing a mobile home or transferring to another unit in a notice for non-payment of rent. These charges are permitted under the RTA, but the RTA does not provide for their recovery in an application to the Landlord Tenant Board (LTB). Therefore, a landlord should not include such charges in a notice for non-payment of rent."

You may also file your own application to have the LTB consider these issues."
What can I do if my landlord refuses to fix something in my rental unit?,"You can file an application with the Landlord Tenant Board and request the LTB to order the landlord to fix the issue.

According to section 69(2) of the RTA, the application may not be filed later than 30 days after the termination date in the notice. If the application is filed late, it should be dismissed."
How do I file an affidavit or declaration for eviction for personal use?,"You can file an affidavit sworn by the person who requires the rental unit for their own personal use for at least one year.

Can a landlord give me a notice under section 49 without an agreement of purchase and sale?,"No, before a landlord may give a notice under section 49, there must be an agreement of purchase and sale for the residential complex or condominium unit. The LTB may refuse an application if it is not reasonably certain that a completed sale will result from the agreement."
Can I be evicted if my landlord sells the property?,"The Landlord Tenant Board may dismiss the application if they believe the sale is a pretence created for the purpose of evicting the tenant.

The LTB will look at the real nature of the transaction as directed by Section 202 of the RTA."
