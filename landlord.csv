Payments made prior to the hearing cannot be listed in the affidavit because those payments should be included in the order. If the tenant believes that the order is incorrect because it does not include all the payments that were made before the hearing, the tenant may consider filing a request to review the order."
What happens after the order is enforceable?,"After the order is enforceable, the Landlord Tenant Board (LTB) will hold a hearing on the motion. If the LTB determines that the tenant has not paid the arrears and any additional rent owing, as well as any NSF and administration charges and costs ordered by the LTB, the LTB will make an order denying the motion and lifting the stay. If the LTB determines that the tenant has paid the arrears and any additional rent owing, as well as any NSF and administration charges and costs ordered by the LTB, the LTB will make an order finding the eviction order to be void.
